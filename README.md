# ccna-project
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a multi-switch, multi-router network using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
Switches and VLANs were configured, Spanning Tree Protocol applied to prevent loops, and DHCP set up for automatic IP assignment.  
EIGRP and OSPF routing were implemented between routers, ACLs applied to control access, and SSH with RADIUS authentication enabled for secure management.  
Also DNS, Web, Mail, and RADIUS servers were configured and integrated within the network.
